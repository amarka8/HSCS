/**
 * An Event object has an instance variable to indicate at which time it should be processed. When that time has arrived, the eventâ€™s process method is called. This method may move objects around, update information, and schedule additional events.
The Event class also implements the Comparable interface. An event is considered more urgent than another if its processing time is earlier.
