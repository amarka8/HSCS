// Write a class that has a month number and year number. Include a method that returns whether the year is a
// leap year. Include a method that returns the number of days in the objectâ€™s month. Use an if statement that has
// no more than four code paths and calls the method that determines if the year is a leap year. Include a
// method that returns what season it is based on the month and day.
// Years divisible by 100 are not leap years unless they are also divisible by 400. Years divisible by 4 are leap
// years unless they excluded by the criteria described in the previous sentence.
// Spring runs from March 22 to June 21, summer from June 22 to September 21, fall from September 22 to December
// 21, and winter from December 22 to March 21.
